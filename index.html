                A recent report by the American Road and Transportation Builders Association cited that 11% of bridges in New York are classified as structurally deficient. To be classified as such one or more of the key elements, such as the deck, superstructure or
                substructure is considered to be in “poor or worse condition. 26% are classified as functionally obsolete. Necessary repairs to bridges in New York will cost an estimated $75 billion.

                "There are a growing number of deficient bridges across the country according to the report," said Eileen Houlihan, the Media Manager at the American Road and Transportation Builders Association.
